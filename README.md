# SlowLang Project

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/peterKRU/slow-lang-compiler/master/docs/SlowLang_2.jpg "SlowLang Logo")

***
SlowLang is a class-based, object-oriented programming language designed for modularity and ease of extensibility. 
Its primary purpose is to serve as a robust foundation for developing domain-specific languages with more complex syntax 
and features. 

It can also be used an a general-purpose language for developing applications, although there is no good reason for using it as such. SlowLang's name reflects its emphasis on ease of maintenance and extensibility over execution speed. 

Some key haracteristics:
- Simplified C-like syntax
- Separate front-end compiler
- Custom Bytecode compilation
- Separate Virtual Machine with JVM-inspired architecture
- Garbage Collection
- Dynamic switching of interpretation behavior
- Native utils library
- Flexible architecture with pipelines for adding new features

### Key Features

Here is a comprehensive list of SlowLang's key features with example code (**click the arrows for example code**):

<details><summary>Standard features: SlowLang includes all the standard features of a programming language, such as arithmetic operations, logical operations, and more.</summary>
<p>

#### Here is a SlowLang block of code which is the programming equivalent of "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog":

```
main {
    x = 5, y = 10;
    a = true, b = false;
    result = (x + y) * (x - y) / (x * y) % (x / y) + (++x) - (--y) + (x >> 2) + (x << 2) + (x >>> 2) & (x | y) ^ (x & y) || (a && b);
}
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Implicit types: SlowLang has implicit types, meaning that the type of a variable is inferred from its value.</summary>
<p>

#### Implicit and explicit declaration of an integer, string and a user-defined class:

```
main {
    x = 1;
    y = "ololo";
    z = new ExampleClass(x, y);
}
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Object-oriented: SlowLang is an object-oriented language and has classes and interfaces.</summary>
<p>

#### Example of interface and class definition:

```
interface ExampleInterface {
    
    public void exampleMethod();
}

class ExampleClass implements ExampleInterface {
    
    @Implement
    public void exampleMethod(){
        ```
    }
}   
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Straightforward organizational structure: SlowLang has a straightforward organizational structure that includes a main execution block followed by class definitions. Classes can be written in separate documents, but the compiler assembles them into a single monolithic document.</summary>
<p>

#### Every program follows the following structure (main block -> classes -> intefaces):

```
main {
    ```
}

class {
    ```
}

interface {
    ```
}

```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>No Inheritance, supports Interface Units instead: The less time you spend pondering over the ontological difference between abstract classes and interfaces the more time you spend actually writing interfaces. Hue hue.</summary>
<p>

#### If you really, really want to replicate iheritance you can use Interface Unit. An Interface Unit is a collection of interfaces which can be implemented as a single interface:

```
main {
    ```
}

class ExampleClass implements ExampleUnit {
    ```
}

interface ExampleInterface comprises ExampleUnit{
    ```
}

interface AnotherInterface comprises ExampleUnit{
    ```
}

```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Native Utils Library: SlowLang has a native utils library which includes implementation of all relevant data structures, such as Array, HashMap, BST, Set, etc.</summary>
<p>

#### You have all relevant data structures at your disposal:

```
main {
    dynamicArray = new DynamicArray(1, 2, 3);
    linkedList = new LinkedList(4, 5, 6);
    
    stack = new Stack(dynamicArray + linkedList);
    hashMap = new HashMap();
    
    exampleString = "ololo";
    hashMap.put(exampleString, stack.pop());
    
    binaryTree = new BinaryTree(exampleString, hashMap.get(exampleString));
}

```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Garbage Collection: SlowLang has a garbage collector that automatically frees up memory that is no longer being used. The GC also supports explicit memory dealocation.</summary>
<p>

#### Garbage Collection is automatic, however the user can choose to explicitly mark objects for deletion. The Garbage Collecor will sweep them during the next scheduled garbage collection:

```
main {
    exampleObject = new ExampleClass();
    print(exampleObject);
    GC.collect(exampleObject);
}
```

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Virtual Machine interpreter: SlowLang's virtual machine interpreter can alter its behavior during runtime.</summary>
<p>

#### Here is a diagram showing high-level overview of SlowLang's Virtual Machine:

[TODO: insert diagram]

</p>
</details>

<details><summary>Chain of Opcode Executors: SlowLang's virtual machine uses a chain of opcode executors which can be easily extended, assembled and rearranged.</summary>
<p>

#### Here is a UML class diagram showing SlowLang's chain of opcode executors:

[TODO: insert diagram]

</p>
</details>

These features make SlowLang a flexible and versatile programming language that is well-suited for building upon.

### Example Program
***
Here is an example of the classical merge sort algorithm implemented in SlowLang:

```
main {
    array = {38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10};
    mergeSort(array);
    print(array);
}

class MergeSort implements SortingAlgorithm{
    
    @Implement
    public static sort(array: int[]) -> void {
        
        mergeSort(array);
    }
    
    public static mergeSort(array: int[]) -> void {
        
        if (array.length < 2) {
            return;
        }
        mid = arr.length / 2;
        left = Utils.copyRange(array, 0, mid);
        right = Utils.copyRange(arr, mid, array.length);
        mergeSort(left);
        mergeSort(right);
        merge(array, left, right);
    }

    public static merge(arr: int[], left: int[], right: int[]) -> void{
        
        i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
        
        while (i < left.length && j < right.length) {
            
            if (left[i] <= right[j]) {
                arr[k++] = left[i++];
            } else {
                arr[k++] = right[j++];
            }
        }
        
        while (i < left.length) {
            arr[k++] = left[i++];
        }
        while (j < right.length) {
            arr[k++] = right[j++];
        }
    }
}

interface SortingAlgorithm {
    
    public sort(array: int) -> void;
}

```
***
Here is an example SlowLang program that demonstrates some of the main features of object-oriented programming, including classes, interfaces, and interface units:

```

class Rectangle implements PolygonShape {
    
    private length;
    private  width;
    private  numberOfSides;
    
    public Rectangle(length: double, width: double) {
        
        this.numberOfSides = PolygonShape.Polygon.getNumberOfSides();
        this.length = length;
        this.width = width;
    }
    
    @Implement
    public getNumberOfSides(){
        
        return 4;
    }
    
    public double getLength() {
        return length;
    }

    public double getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    @Implement
    public getArea() {
        return length * width;
    }

    @Implement
    public getPerimeter() {
        return 2 * (length + width);
    }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    
    private radius;

    public Circle(radius: double){
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    public getRadius() -> double{
        return radius;
    }

    @Implement
    public double getArea() {
        return Math.PI * radius * radius;
    }

    @Implement
    public double getPerimeter() {
        return 2 * Math.PI * radius;
    }
}

interface Shape comprises PolygonShape{
    
    getArea() -> double;
    getPerimeter() -> double;
}

interface Polygon comprises PolygonShape {
    
    public getNumberOfSides() -> int {
        
        return 4;
    }
}

unit PolygonShape {
    
    ```        
}
```
